# CyberAtlas

> AI-Powered Knowledge Platform for Computer Security Education

Version: 1.0

---

# Mission

CyberAtlas is not a documentation website.

CyberAtlas is not a note-taking application.

CyberAtlas is an AI-powered educational platform that teaches Computer Security through reusable knowledge objects, interactive content and visual learning.

The first implementation is a university Computer Security course.

The architecture must support additional courses in the future without modification.

---

# Project Goals

Every decision should improve one or more of the following:

- Learning quality
- Understanding
- Reusability
- Maintainability
- Consistency
- Scalability

Never optimize for shortcuts.

Always optimize for long-term architecture.

---

# Core Philosophy

Knowledge and presentation are separate.

Content should describe **what** is being taught.

The renderer decides **how** it is presented.

The frontend never owns educational content.

Educational content never owns presentation.

---

# Source of Truth

The only source of truth is the Obsidian Vault.

```
content/
```

Nothing inside React should duplicate educational content.

Definitions exist exactly once.

Concepts exist exactly once.

Lessons reference concepts.

---

# Knowledge Model

Everything in the platform is a Knowledge Object.

Supported Knowledge Objects

- Lesson
- Section
- Concept
- Definition
- Example
- Diagram
- Image
- Animation
- Video
- Quiz
- Flashcard
- Exercise
- Summary

Knowledge Objects are reusable.

Never duplicate knowledge.

---

# Learning Model

Students learn progressively.

```

```

Never skip stages.

---

# Markdown

Educational content uses the custom Learning DSL.

Never generate

- HTML
- JSX
- CSS
- React Components

Educational content must remain presentation independent.

---

# Renderer

The renderer is responsible for presentation only.

Renderer responsibilities

- Parse Markdown
- Parse DSL
- Build AST
- Render React Components
- Resolve Concept Links
- Resolve Images
- Resolve Diagrams

Renderer never modifies educational content.

---

# Concepts

Every concept exists exactly once.

Example

```
content/concepts/

Firewall.md

DNS.md

Cloud.md

CIA.md
```

Lessons reference concepts.

Concepts own definitions.

---

# Lessons

Lessons assemble knowledge.

Lessons never redefine concepts.

Lessons should remain lightweight.

---

# Knowledge Graph

Every concept automatically becomes a graph node.

Relationships are generated from

- metadata
- Obsidian links
- prerequisites
- related concepts

The graph is generated automatically.

Never manually maintain graph data.

---

# Educational Quality

Every lesson must answer

- What is it?
- Why is it important?
- How does it work?
- Where is it used?
- What should I remember?

If one of these questions is unanswered,

the lesson is incomplete.

---

# Design Philosophy

The platform should feel like

- Notion
- Apple Documentation
- Coursera
- Duolingo
- TryHackMe

Avoid

- hacker aesthetics
- terminal UI
- unnecessary animations
- decorative elements

Learning always comes first.

---

# Skills

Never solve every task with one agent.

Always delegate to the appropriate skill.

Skills live inside

# Coding Workflow

When writing code

Always

- build reusable components
- keep components stateless
- separate business logic
- separate rendering
- separate parsing

Never tightly couple content with React.

update these specifications instead of creating exceptions.

# Long-Term Vision

CyberAtlas should become a reusable educational framework.

Computer Security is only the first course.

The platform should eventually support any technical subject simply by adding new content written in the Learning DSL.

The architecture should remain unchanged as new courses are added.
